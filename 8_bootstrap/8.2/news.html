                Jerusalem: Opposition to mooted Trump Israel announcement grows

                    <p>Opposition is growing in the Arab world to an expected announcement by Donald Trump that the US will
                        recognise Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.</p>
                </blockquote>
                <img src="img/news_01_01.jpg" alt="">
                <p>
                    <b> say the president will make the statement this week but will further delay acting on a campaign pledge
                        to move the US embassy to the city. </b>
                </p>
                <p>The head of the Arab League, Jordan and the Palestinian president have warned of the consequences of a declaration.
                    The city's fate is one of the thorniest issues between Israel and the Arabs. A deadline for Donald Trump
                    to sign a waiver delaying the relocation of the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem expires on Monday.</p>
                <p>Every president, including Mr Trump, has signed the waiver every six months since US Congress passed an act
                    in 1995 calling for the embassy to be moved. Mr Trump repeatedly pledged during his election campaign
                    to move the embassy, and while he has said it was still his intention, he has not yet done so. There
                    are signs however he will make a statement on Wednesday announcing Washington's recognition of Jerusalem
                    as the capital of Israel while holding off moving the embassy.</p>
                <h2>What's so contentious about the move?</h2>
                <p>
                    <b>The status of Jerusalem goes to the heart of Israel's conflict with the Palestinians, who are backed
                        by the rest of the Arab and wider Islamic world. The city is home to key religious sites sacred to
                        Judaism, Islam and Christianity, especially in East Jerusalem. Map of Jerusalem</b>
                </p>
                <p>Israel occupied the area in the 1967 Middle East war and regards the entire city as its indivisible capital.
                    The Palestinians claim East Jerusalem as the capital of a future state, and according to 1993 Israel-Palestinian
                    peace accords its final status is meant to discussed in the latter stages of peace talks. </p>
                <p> sovereignty over Jerusalem has never been recognised internationally, and all countries, including Israel's
                    closest ally the US, maintain their embassies in Tel Aviv, Israel's commercial capital. Since 1967, Israel
                    has built a dozen settlements, home to about 200,000 Jews, in East Jerusalem. </p>
                <p>These are considered illegal under international law, though Israel disputes this. If the US recognises Jerusalem
                    as Israel's capital, it will put it out-of-step with the rest of the international community and reinforce
                    Israel's position that settlements in the east are valid Israeli communities. </p>
                <p>It would also raise a question over how the US will treat resolutions dealing with East Jerusalem at the
                    UN. The US has a power of veto and could use this to block future motions critical of Israeli policy
                    in the east.</p>

                <h2>What has been the reaction in the Arab world?</h2>
                <p>
                    <b> There is growing anger towards Washington among its allies in the Middle East.</b>
                </p>
                <p> Jordan, the custodian of Islamic holy sites in Jerusalem, has warned of "grave consequences" if Donald Trump
                    goes ahead, and has called for an emergency meeting of key regional and Islamic blocs the Arab League
                    and the Organization of the Islamic Conference to discuss the issue.</p>
                <p> Arab League chief Abul Gheit warned such a move would "nourish fanaticism and violence". Palestinian President
                    Mahmoud Abbas has contacted world leaders urging them to intervene, saying "such a US decision would
                    destroy the peace process and drag the region into further instability". </p>
                <p> Will Donald Trump definitely make the announcement? It remains uncertain though whether the president will
                    recognise Israeli sovereignty over Jerusalem. The White House has neither confirmed nor denied his intention,
                    and in a rare public speech on Sunday his son-in-law and advisor Jared Kushner refused to be drawn on
                    the issue. </p>
                <p> "The president is going to make his decision and he's still looking at a lot of different facts," he told
                    the Saban Forum in Washington. "When he makes his decision he'll be the one to want to tell you, not
                    me," he said.
